###### [Verse 1]
We'll do it all  
Everything  
On our own  

We don't need  
Anything  
Or anyone  
###### [Chorus]
If I lay here  
If I just lay here  
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?  
###### [Verse 2]
I don't quite know  
How to say  
How I feel  

Those three words  
Are said too much  
They're not enough  
###### [Chorus]
If I lay here  
If I just lay here  
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?  

Forget what we're told  
Before we get too old  
Show me a garden that's bursting into life  
###### [Verse 3]
Let's waste time  
__Chasing cars__  
Around our heads  

I need your grace  
To remind me  
To find my own  
###### [Chorus]
If I lay here  
If I just lay here  
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?  

Forget what we're told  
Before we get too old  
Show me a garden that's bursting into life  
###### [Bridge]
*All that I am*  
*All that I ever was*  
*Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see*  

*I don't know where*  
*Confused about how as well*  
*Just know that these things will never change for us at all*  
###### [Chorus]
If I lay here  
If I just lay here  
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
