###### [Verse 1]
White lips, pale face  
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste  
Light's gone, days end  
Struggling to pay rent  
Long nights, strange men  
###### [Pre-Chorus]
And they say  
She's in the Class __A Team__  
Stuck in her daydream  
Been this way since 18  
But lately, her face seems  
Slowly sinking, wasting  
Crumbling like pastries  
And they scream  
The worst things in life come free to us  
###### [Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand  
And go mad for a couple grams  
And she don't wanna go outside tonight  
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland  
Or sells love to another man  
It's too cold outside  
For angels to fly  
Angels to fly  
###### [Verse 2]
Ripped gloves, raincoat  
Tried to swim, stay afloat  
Dry house, wet clothes  
Loose change, bank notes  
Weary-eyed, dry throat  
Call girl, no phone  
###### [Pre-Chorus]
And they say  
She's in the Class __A Team__  
Stuck in her daydream  
Been this way since 18  
But lately, her face seems  
Slowly sinking, wasting  
Crumbling like pastries  
And they scream  
The worst things in life come free to us  
###### [Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand  
And go mad for a couple grams  
But she don't wanna go outside tonight  
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland  
Sells love to another man  
It's too cold outside  
For angels to fly  
###### [Bridge]
An angel will die  
Covered in white  
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life  
This time, we'll fade out tonight  
Straight down the line  
###### [Pre-Chorus]
And they say  
She's in the Class __A Team__  
Stuck in her daydream  
Been this way since 18  
But lately, her face seems  
Slowly sinking, wasting  
Crumbling like pastries  
They scream  
The worst things in life come free to us  
###### [Chorus]
And we're all under the upper hand  
And go mad for a couple grams  
And we don't wanna go outside tonight  
And in the pipe, fly to the motherland  
Or sell love to another man  
It's too cold outside  
For angels to fly  
Angels to fly  
*Fly, fly*  
*For angels to fly, to fly, to fly*  
*Angels to die*
